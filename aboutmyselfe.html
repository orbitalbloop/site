<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is <b>Christopher</b>, online I go by <b>OrbitalBloop</b> or simply <b>Orb</b>.
<p>My interests lie in the following mediums:
<p> - Traditional art (for as long as i can remember lol)
<br> - Digital art (since 2011)
<br> - Game development & programming (since 2013)
<br> - Music composition (since 2016)
<p>
<br><b><u>Programming/game engine experience</u></b>:
<br> - Lua (earliest programming language, primarily game projects in LÃ–VE)
<br> - Python (primarily various non-game programming projects)
<br> - Gamemaker Studio (1.4 & 2)
